## About Time-Flow (a Time Banking System App)

[WebApp Access] https://time-flow.app/

Time-Flow is a WebApp for time exchanging between people. You can use it with friends, associations, companies, etc.
Time-Flow is open, all accounts are public: From your user panel, you will see the history of your exchanges and you can see the history of other users

Time-Flow is infinite: There are no credit limits. You can have hundreds of positive hours on your account or hundreds of hours with a negative balance. The limits are decided by the users

Time-Flow is like PayPal or a bank, but the exchanges are in hours and minutes instead of money

Use 100% Time-Flow or combine it with other currencies. The decision is yours and the person you trade with
